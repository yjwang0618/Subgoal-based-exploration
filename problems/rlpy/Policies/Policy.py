    The Agent learns about the :py:class:`~rlpy.Domains.Domain.Domain`
    as the two interact.
    At each step, the Agent passes information about its current state
    to the Policy; the Policy uses this to decide what discrete action the
    Agent should perform next (see :py:meth:`~rlpy.Policies.Policy.Policy.pi`) \n

    policies. It provides the methods and attributes that allow child classes
    to interact with the Agent and Representation within the RLPy library. \n
