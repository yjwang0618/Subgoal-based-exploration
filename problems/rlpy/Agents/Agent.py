    """Learning Agent for obtaining good policices.

    The Agent receives observations from the Domain and incorporates their
    new information into the representation, policy, etc. as needed.

    In a typical Experiment, the Agent interacts with the Domain in discrete
    timesteps.
    At each Experiment timestep the Agent receives some observations from the Domain
    which it uses to update the value function Representation of the Domain
    (ie, on each call to its :py:meth:`~rlpy.Agents.Agent.Agent.learn` function).
    The Policy is used to select an action to perform.
    This process (observe, update, act) repeats until some goal or fail state,
    determined by the Domain, is reached. At this point the
    :py:class:`~rlpy.Experiments.Experiment.Experiment` determines
    whether the agent starts over or has its current policy tested
    (without any exploration).

    :py:class:`~rlpy.Agents.Agent.Agent` is a base class that provides the basic
    framework for all RL Agents. It provides the methods and attributes that
    allow child classes to interact with the
    :py:class:`~rlpy.Domains.Domain.Domain`,
    :py:class:`~rlpy.Representations.Representation.Representation`,
    :py:class:`~rlpy.Policies.Policy.Policy`, and
    :py:class:`~rlpy.Experiments.Experiment.Experiment` classes within the
    RLPy library.

    .. note::
        All new agent implementations should inherit from this class.
