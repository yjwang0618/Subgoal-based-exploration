    Compact tabular representation with linearly independent basis functions.

    This representation is identical to IndependentDiscretization except when binary features exist in the state-space
    In such case the feature corresponding to the 0 values of binary dimension are excluded.
    Furthermore an extra feature is added to the representation which is activated only if all dimensions are binary and non of them are active
    Based on preliminary mathematical formulation both this representation
    and the non-compact representation will have the same representational
    power in the limit.
